1> How authetication works?
    -> client first signup/login on the browser. Server validates those credetials and return the success message of login with JSON token.
       Server creates this token from some algorithm and encode the token before sending. Server only knows how to decode this token.
       Now, server sends this encoded to client. Now client sends this token to server with its subsequent http request n header and server decode the token.
       If server finds its a wrong token, the http request will fail then.

2>  Authetication - process of verifying the user's identity
    Authorization - process of find the user's accessbility for some resources

3> JWT - A client application must submit a JWT in the authorization header of an HTTP request to our
         backend API to authenticate a user.
